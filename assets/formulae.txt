TIME AND WORK :

1. Work from Days:

If A can do a piece of work in n days, then A's 1 day's work =	1/n.
2. Days from Work:
	If A's 1 day's work = 1/n , then A can finish the work in n days.

3. Ratio:
	If A is thrice as good a workman as B, then:
	Ratio of work done by A and B = 3 : 1.
	Ratio of times taken by A and B to finish a work = 1 : 3.



AVERAGE :

Average = Sum of observations / Number of observations

Average Speed:
	Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x kmph and an equal distance at y kmph.
	Then, the average speed druing the whole journey is	2xy / (x + y) kmph.




AGES :

1. If the current age is x, then n times the age is nx.

2. If the current age is x, then age n years later/hence = x + n.

3. If the current age is x, then age n years ago = x - n.

4. The ages in a ratio a : b will be ax and bx.

5. If the current age is x, then 1/n of the age is	x/n.
